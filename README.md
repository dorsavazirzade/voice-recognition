## Overview

This project focuses on gender classification based on features extracted from audio data. The objective is to design and evaluate a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and analyze its performance under different configurations and conditions.


Key components of the project include:

*  **MLP Design:** Implementing a three-layer MLP with an appropriate number of neurons in each layer for gender classification.
*  **Performance Comparison:** Comparing the accuracy of the MLP with Logistic Regression.
*  **Activation Functions:** Investigating the impact of different activation functions, including ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
*  **Neurons in the Hidden Layer:** Analyzing how the number of neurons in the second hidden layer affects network accuracy.
*  **Dropout:** Evaluating the effect of applying dropout on the network's accuracy.
*  **Training:** Training the network for 100 epochs to assess its performance.


This project provides insights into the impact of various design choices in neural networks and can serve as a foundation for further exploration in audio-based classification tasks.
